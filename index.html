    <p>
      I am a mother of three and a Nigerian Lady. Wow...I was so excited when I got the mail from SheCodes
      for a scholarship. I want to appreciate SheCodes for giving me this opportunity to learn and upgrade my skills.
      This is a very promising profession and it is worth devoting my time and energy.
      God will make me what the nations are looking for.
